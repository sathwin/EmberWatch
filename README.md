# EmberWatch
EmberWatch is an AI-driven wildfire detection system designed to identify fires in real-time using computer vision and machine learning. Unlike existing systems, EmberWatch is built from scratch, leveraging a custom-trained CNN model (no pre-trained networks) for accurate fire detection in satellite and drone imagery.
